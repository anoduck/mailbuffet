> A crude, but effective, means to process Google's Takeout mbox archive into individual markdown files.

## Install

The project was created using python poetry [https://python-poetry.org](https://python-poetry.org), but poetry is not required for installation, and pipenv can be used for installation if preferred. 

```sh
poetry install
# or
pipenv install
```

## Usage

As all options refer to a path, and the script does not resolve these paths to absolute paths or user home directory relative paths, the user will need to run the script denoting the full path to satisfy the option or use relative path from this project repository. 

* `--mbox_file`: The path to the mbox file generated by Google Takeout. The mbox file is a mbox format mail message archive. There are several mbox file formats. See [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190) for more information.
* `--outdir`: The output directory to store the individual markdown files. These files will not be converted to html, they will be markdown with frontmatter as is used with most static site generators.
* `--priv`: The path to the sensitive keyphrase file. The file is a text file containing one keyphrase per line.
* `--webpath`: This is the path to where the markdown files will be located on your webserver. For example, if your webserver is located at `/Documents/emails`, then `webpath` should be `/Documents/emails`.

```sh
poetry run python mailbuffet.py --mbox_file file.mbox --outdir ./output --priv ./sensitive.txt --webpath /Documents/emails
```
